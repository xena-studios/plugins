# Decisions

Why the plugins are built the way they are. Newest last.

## One minimum version: Paper 1.21.11, Java 21 (2026-10-21)

Every plugin supports the same oldest Paper, so the core is written once against one API. 1.21.11 is the last 1.21 release and still widely run; 26.x needs Java 25, so building for 1.21.11 with Java 21 bytecode covers both. xLimbo drops 1.18.2. Raising the minimum is a breaking change and needs a new major version.

## The rewrite ships as new majors, one plugin at a time (2026-10-21)

xUtilities 2, then zChat 3, then xLimbo 2, each released before the next starts, so the docs always describe released versions. Each carries old configs forward automatically, backing up the old file first. The old source is gone; the docs are the spec.

## The core is shaded into each plugin, never installed on its own (2026-10-21)

Server owners install one jar per plugin and nothing else. Each plugin relocates its copy of the core (`co.xenastudios.<plugin>.core`), so plugins built on different core versions never clash, and `minimize()` drops the core classes a plugin doesn't use.

## Commands are registered at runtime, so command changes apply on reload (2026-10-21)

Spike (`sandbox/`, checked in CI): a command registered through the Bukkit command map after startup runs by name, alias and `namespace:name`, tab-completes, and appears in the command tree the server sends clients. Removing it from `getKnownCommands()` takes it out of that tree, and re-registering with new aliases drops the old ones. Each takes well under 10 ms. This passes on Paper and Folia, 1.21.11 and 26.3.

So turning a command on or off, its aliases and permission, and adding or removing link commands can all apply on `/<plugin> reload` (followed by `Player#updateCommands`), instead of needing a restart. A disabled command isn't registered at all, so another plugin can take its name. Paper's Brigadier lifecycle API can't do this: it only registers at startup and on a datapack reload.

Still to confirm with a real client in phase 1: that `updateCommands` refreshes tab completion for players already online.

Gotcha: a command dispatched while another command is running is queued until that one finishes, so code that dispatches commands must run outside a command's execution.

## Configs are generated from a schema in code (2026-10-21)

Spike (`core/src/test/.../ConfigEmissionSpikeTest`): Paper's `YamlConfiguration` writes a commented config and reads it back with no server running. Each plugin declares its settings once (default, validation, comment); the same declaration writes the default `config.yml`, reads and checks the live one, and can generate the docs' "full default config" at build time, so the docs can't drift from the code.

## Boot tests on real servers (2026-10-21)

`scripts/boot-test.sh` boots a real Paper or Folia server with the plugin jars, runs console commands, stops it, and fails on any error in the log or any warning from our plugins. CI runs it at the minimum version and the newest, on both. Unit tests can't catch a plugin that fails to enable, or a Folia threading mistake; this does.
